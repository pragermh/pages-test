Molecular biodiversity data in SBDI
===================================

The
`Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (SBDI) <https://biodiversitydata.se/>`\_
is developed in collaboration with the
`Living Atlas Community <https://living-atlases.gbif.org/>`*, and aims
to make Swedish biodiversity data accessible for integrative analysis in
a `single platform <https://bioatlas.se/>`*. As part of this effort, we
want to make it easier to publish, access and use molecular biodiversity
data, i.e. sequence-based observations derived from metabarcoding or
metagenomics studies of environmental samples.

We provide a step-by-step `guide to ENA submission <ena-metabar.html>`\_
of raw reads , and are currently collaborating on a scripted
`pipeline for denoising and taxonomic annotation <https://nf-co.re/ampliseq>`\_
of amplicon sequencing data, from both Illumina and PacBio platforms.
For anyone interested in sharing or using ASV occurrence data, we are
also developing a `molecular module <sbdi-mol-mod.html>`\_ to help
integrate ASV occurrences into the
`BioAtlas portal <https://bioatlas.se/>`\_.

SBDI data flow and services for amplicon sequence data.

Our molecular services are under development, but we hope to ingest and
display or first ASV data by the end of 2020. Please email any
suggestions or questions, e.g. regarding data submission, to
`SBDI Molecular Data Support`\_.
